### Hi

I'm a student at Northwestern pursuing a B.S. in Applied Mathematics and M.S. in Computer Science. 

On my GitHub page, you'll find projects I've done in computer science, applied mathematics, robotics, and mechanical engineering.  Some notable ones I've done are creating a SQL environment in C, an autonomous drone that picks up boxes, Machine Dynamics Simulations in Python, and some CAD projects I've done over the years.
