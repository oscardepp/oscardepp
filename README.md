### Hi

I'm a student at Northwestern pursuing a B.S. in Applied Mathematics and M.S. in Computer Science. 

On my GitHub page, you'll find computer science, applied mathematics, robotics, aerospace, and design projects I've done in classes and in my free time. My projects blends together creative design with computer science and simulation work. Below you will find links to my work!
