            written.
            I'm inspired by wriiting that confront everyday banality, fragmented experiences, linguistic
            tongues,
            and changing cosmopolitan culture. My favorite pieces of work are from Karl Ove Knausgaard, Zadie
            Smith,
            and Amor Towles.

                <h3>A Short Story</h3>

                <p>“What does my arm taste like?” </p>

                <p> “Why don’t you taste it?”</p>

                <p> “What time is it?” </p>

                <p>“Half-past four.”</p>

                <p>If not for the long and awkward pauses, Frank might’ve thought this girl called the wrong
                  number. Who
                  would ask anyone what their arm tastes like at five in the morning? But her voice–so
                  unafraid and
                  vibrant, so without hesitation, and so full of joy–kept him talking. Frank briefly
                  closed his eyes
                  before the peculiar girl asked another question. </p>

                <p>“Will you listen?” She asked. </p>

                <p>“Of course.”</p>

                <p>She didn’t say anything back, but he could hear her making mouth noises against the
                  phone. He was
                  curious by the puzzling voice in his ear but also hardly listening–it was too hot and
                  early to be
                  answering her questions. It reminded him of a time when he also wanted to taste
                  everything in sight.
                  Her untamed voice brought him back to the call. </p>

                <p>“Hey old man, where do the stars sleep?” </p>

                <p>“Under the sky’s blanket,” he firmly replied. </p>

                <p>“Then… where does the sky sleep?” she pressed. </p>

                <p>“In the clouds,” he riposted, with a big yawn coming over his face.</p>

                <p>“Well then, what does my arm taste like?”</p>

                <p>Before he could answer, her voice faded into a murmur and wandered out the room. Frank’s
                  eyes started
                  drooping, and his head crumbled into the desk. Sweat from his right arm clung to his
                  skin and
                  drizzled down to his wrist, where it finally hit his mouth. The salt hit him like a slap
                  in the
                  face. </p>

                <p>He ended the call shortly after, left in a confused state. But at least he knew what an
                  arm tasted
                  like.

                <p>The door clicks its tongue and out its mouth comes the old lady next door with her broom.
                  The sunlight encroaches the window, opening my room light. Construction workers line up
                  in a haphazard line to buy breakfast at the local deli, yelling their orders at the
                  chef. One egg, a sausage patty, and some red onions, all sandwiched in an oversized
                  focaccia. The smell and noise start to consume my bedroom. A wave of children chase only
                  after the sound of the hollow air of a basketball compressing into the ground. The
                  morning starts to get a character of its own, and I know it’s time to get breakfast and
                  hop on the train.</p>

                <h3>A Short Story</h3>
                <p>“What’s that?” Eva asked, pointing to the dining table, as she saw a lady juggling plates
                  seeming to contain chocolate cake. Some of Eva’s school friends dropped their train
                  tracks and looked at the mother walking back & forth from the kitchen.</p>

                <p>“Dinner’s ready!” she announced, as children began to flood in from all corners.</p>

                <p>“I’m hungry. I want some food. I want some!” Eva repeated with more urgency. I looked at
                  her again; she was now jumping up & down.</p>

                <p>“Go.”</p>

                <p>From a reflection of the window, a clock showed it was a quarter to six. A man near the
                  curtains sighed while his wife went to help with the food. Strollers with three-year
                  old’s lay inert. Shadows filled creases of the parents’ faces, as they talked about fat
                  percentages in avocado.</p>

                <p>Eva scurried over to the other children and raised her chin to look at the food. She
                  turned back, making sure I saw her frugal expression and heard her feet scratch the
                  ground. </p>

                <p>“It’s all green. Can we go home, pappa?” It was beans & casseroles for a birthday party
                  dinner. The other children seemed ecstatic about the food, with parents smiling at their
                  creative creations.</p>

                <p>“There’s cake! It’s celery though,” I said, stroking Eva’s hair. She dropped her head,
                  glancing away from the crowd she just played with. Everything parents did here always
                  seemed to blend, and everyone seemed blind to the fact that children were eating celery
                  for dessert.</p>

                <p>“Let’s go.” We skipped the salad.</p>

                <h3>A Short Story</h3>
                <p>“Hurry up! It’s time to go!” a distant voice echoes through the chamber. Somewhere within
                  the cavernous space, I hear thundering footsteps approach the entreating entrance to the
                  inner door. Piercing torchlights tear through my cheek. Something stirs. The darkness
                  within the passageway suddenly feels heavier than the darkness on the ceiling. The
                  rumbling of the floor stops, and my slumber cuts short, with visitors too curious to not
                  lose themselves in the enchanted desert land.</p>

                <p>I am a dead man in the Valley of Kings. Not many days ago, I lived and died. Nobody
                  significant–I died at 19. For some, 19 is enough to be significant, so much so that I’m
                  buried deep beyond any human reach. In this room, there is a deadness not familiar to
                  me. Not the death that suggests life has ceased, but the total absence of it that lives
                  as a bodiless entity, in the same way there’s no life in a stone or chair. It’s me, my
                  unopened funeral presents, my unused ship into the afterlife, and my empty kitchen. The
                  uneasy atmosphere dispels with the entrance of the footsteps.</p>

                <p>A pungent waft of smoky wood perfume penetrates my nostrils. Bandages weld and fasten
                  the cracked bones of what used to be my face together, revealing the grimace of another
                  man. Stones assemble painfully across my face, but I cannot feel it–my humbling servants
                  had excavated all of the organs I needed to breathe, smell, and feel the living vitality
                  around me. Perhaps, living in an isolated tomb, I have no need for such functions. As a
                  being lacking the human characteristics of perception, I must conclude I am a different
                  man and being than this rotting container–I am simply the owner of this corpse. I wear a
                  worn body and require no affirmation of existence.</p>

                <p>“Come!” Yousef exclaims, peering at the outline of what appears to be valuables hidden
                  under white cloth near the altar. “A big stack of gold is here!”</p>
                <p>A majestic purple gown, gifted by the Great Spanish King of Cordoba stood adjacent. Its
                  existing beauty is a testament to its incredible age. Yousef quickly rips away the
                  cloth, revealing its shape, detaching the sealed ship from its stand. The intricate main
                  mast bends in half, and the hull withers away into dust, and dissipates to the ground.
                  Yousef, looking up at the gown in regretful contrast, folds the white cloth back over
                  the broken replica.</p>

                <p>“Never mind. I’ve got a screw loose,” Yousef shouts out towards the soundless eternal
                  chamber. Without response, he moves on. The table, consisting of the broken boat to my
                  afterlife hidden under the same white fabric dotted with hieroglyphic script. Next to it
                  sits a clay cruet containing oils and medicine, bearing an elaborate miniature portrait
                  of my face, but he is not interested.</p>

                <p>Yousef is one visitor out of many: musing and wandering through my house, taking my
                  gifts, they never touch the body that carries me. If only they did, they would see the
                  key under my armpit to the real tomb of my father. They become cautious and hesitant,
                  and rush to smaller things, like a cup or a plate in the kitchen. Death is the last
                  great horizon, that’s why it must be kept hidden–under immense boulders, in perpetual
                  darkness, and beyond life.</p>

                <p>Yousef’s senses had finally accustomed to the lifeless, dry air around him. Beyond the
                  edges of the golden sarcophagus and my eyesight, the luminous hue of his torchlight
                  reveals funeral rites that adorn the wall, passages beyond my eyesight. Yousef’s voice
                  emerges:</p>

                <p>Rotting flowers leave behind all the sinned,<br>

                  Freed from its trapping root,<br>

                  The ship follows the blind wind,<br>

                  Dowering the sea with lust and loot.</em></p>

                <p>This was an unfamiliar line, the prose sounded different from the scripture on the
                  ceiling. In fact, those are the only stories I can read, as my corpse and cracked skull
                  faces upwards. I cannot look at anything; only to where the others direct light. My eye
                  sockets are unoccupied cavities, but the visitors seem to be making too much noise that
                  I can see from somewhere else, perhaps directly from my soul.</p>

                <p>Who built this wretched ship?<br>

                  Built on fragile faith and cowering courage<br>

                  The ship is shattered and splintered at every golden arch.<br>

                  Beautiful enough to impress a dead man,<br>

                  But not enough to cross the river.<br>

                  Where are its crew, its wooden oars, and its energy?<br>

                  All the men wash away in dry dust.<br>

                  At least its furnished<br>

                  with food for the flood and flight,<br>

                  beneath the expired, loitering souls.<br>

                  The anchor stops at the harbor,<br>

                  Trying to restore its leaking vitality.<br>

                  Instead it falls, dropping into<br>

                  The dark pit of unanswered and dead prayers<br>

                  From the beds of beadsmen into a low damp ground,<br>

                  Violently shaking in their gurgling breaths. </p>

                <p><em>Hold the torch higher, I cannot see the writing.</em> I could not say anything: this
                  empty
                  chamber only has room for one mouth. He was no longer looking at the writing, but rather
                  downwards to my ornamental furniture. Why were they stealing my boat? The style finally
                  sounds familiar, and I remember the rest of the poem:</p>

                <p>The dark darkens still, splashing sickly tides of black waste<br>

                  Into where it is already dark, voices patter away,<br>

                  Not able to carry the already weakened ship,<br>

                  darkening still the silent battleground.<br>

                  the vessel sways without direction, rocking peacefully<br>

                  there is only the sound of brass bullets and moaning winds clashing<br>

                  against the frail hull.<br>

                  Oh couldn’t they have built a stronger ship?<br>

                  There is nothing left, there is no more here,<br>

                  my little ship is gone.</p>

                <p>“I’m going out to smoke,” Yousef announces, flicking off his flashlight. Certain his
                  friends had abandoned him, he still declared he was going out to quell his guilt that he
                  may be leaving someone behind. I could not tell if he was a local man attempting to rob
                  my expired gifts, if they were, they were fools, my friends with long noses in foreign
                  hats would soon bring me warm shawarma. Every hour felt the same to me, but every
                  footstep sounded slightly different.
                  These men cower too long in the dark.</p>

                <p>A fresh corpse that is dead for one day is different from a thousand-year-old corpse. I
                  had written this while my body was still fresh, before my gifted servants even had a
                  chance to adorn my life with words, before I had lost attachment to the people and
                  objects around me. Time is the cyclic procreant: it hides away the knowledge of my poem
                  in a dark cave, and digs back into the sealed cave with new meaning. Now, I am a being
                  without fruit, without organs to feel, without attachment.</p>

                <p>Alas, it is time to go,<br>

                  With accoutrements and gifts<br>

                  And cooking pans and checker games<br>

                  Fitted for the fleeting soul.<br>

                  The dank frost bites, making the legs shiver,<br>

                  Back to the inception of the Nile river.</p>

                <p>Yousef, perhaps in guilt, lingers before leaving towards the chamber door. After intense
                  sounds of scratching on what looked like smooth papyrus paper, pattering footsteps grew
                  more piercing. Yousef peered at the holes of my unopened eyes. As if directly
                  recognizing my presence, he dropped the note on my chest and sprinted towards the door.
                  Before the wavering paper landed on my body, Yousef was gone. None with life want to be
                  the only ones alone in an empty space.</p>

                <p>Harder to decipher than my language, the characters were lightly marked with chalk,
                  clearly a message to his other colleagues. The symbols on the grease-stained newspaper
                  dated in 2015 read:</p>

                <p>– Cinnamon Toast Crunch<br>
                  –cigarettes<br>
                  –I’m outside.</p>

                <p>The broken silence replaces my uneasiness, and I embrace another slumber. The men run
                  straight home, and the dark plunged deeper into the waste of blurry city lights. Perhaps
                  the men have left to sell my teapots and cooking pans to their people.</p>

                <h3>A Short Story</h3>
                <p>If you can wear one, you can wear them all. Matt dips the nose of his beat-up pink vans
                  into
                  the darker pimples of the pavement–spots of freshly melted puddles of snow.
                  Careful–don’t
                  let the water enter the shoe–only the soles. Darting eyes. The heel of one sneaker dives
                  into the drier and paler pavement. Its face floors the surface. Firm, the cemented shoe
                  forges itself a fresh imprint. Good, no more eyes. He looks back at his ephemeral
                  artwork–a
                  daily ant trail of the daylight shadows. The city once more conquered in some worn-out
                  basketball shoes. Repeat.</p>

                <p>Tick-tock. Goldfish sprinkled around his desk count the number of days left. Matt often
                  skips volunteer work in this way to stare at the ceiling. Four minutes left until 5pm. A
                  small hill of paper-airplanes sit between the desk and the wall. No, four and a couple
                  seconds more to be exact. One hand inserts a cookie between his teeth, the other digs
                  into
                  the fragile stack, feeling around for something with more definite shape. Scrunch. The
                  T.V.
                  Remote.</p>
                <p><em>
                    –Triple trips to Florida. Why do people have the same pair of shoes for the same
                    occasion?<br>

                    –Yeah I found it. 12 hours. What about gas?<br>

                    <p>–Cashapp? No, Venmo.
                  </em></p>

                <p>He keeps a goldfish and a cookie in his mouth, and the muscles supporting his neck relax.
                  His head hurls back freely, retreating into the comforts of his chair. Lifting the
                  cookie
                  only using his lower lip, he contorts his face and sniffs the outer layer. Matt never
                  eats
                  food properly; he treats it like his dog sniffs its own dog.</p>

                <p>Kindness!</p>

                <p>His tongue wraps around the goldfish, feeling the small bumps of salt. He bites his lip.
                  His
                  eyes don’t know where to–Focus, the goldfish is in front of you. They’ve been pulled too
                  far
                  out. Pain rushes to his cheeks. Without time to ease the pain nor any senses to affirm
                  it,
                  he feels its immediate taste–the Goldfish’s orange tang in his mouth and the salty
                  aftertaste. Blood or Goldfish or cookie? Pain has no future but itself, pain is nothing
                  but
                  uncertainty, pain is–Sometimes pain pulls you away from your own weight, from the
                  self-chosen pain. All that remains are its echoes–helping you find the real notes to
                  play.</p>

                <p>Back to life.</p>

                <p>Under the covers, another ray of light enters the room from the right. Had I left the
                  doors
                  open? Shuffling around the entrance and perhaps placing their shoes in the shoe rack,
                  they
                  heed their march into my futon territory. Like an immobile stream wishing to wander, I
                  spread my arms and close my eyes faking absence. After they decide to intrude foreign
                  territory, another voice materializes from the left side of my room. Where were they
                  now?</p>

                <p>Josephine’s cherry Jordan’s stand out when they hit the dank, granule pavement. She hates
                  the immutability of its thumping and beating flow through the streets. Sometimes
                  beautiful,
                  often sad. One day’s perpetual sequence of steps forgotten in spontaneity. Sad. Her
                  automated body functions keep her from watching Kendal and Olivia and Emma and Sophia
                  and
                  Eva pass by. Sad. No cracks, a perfect circle: a bubble.</p>

                <p>The designer and colored creases on her shoes had fallen off. She considered warranty,
                  but
                  Uncle Joey would tell her to buzzer off. The shoe is nothing: time and motion always
                  eats
                  away all the detail. She wants the orange juice. Her eyebrows lift off the edge of
                  Joey’s
                  art pedestal–why was he still here? Joey reaches for a damp paintbrush left on the
                  floor.
                  Guess he was skipping his four-o’clock doctor’s appointment. Slurp.</p>

                <p>Their footsteps stop in front of my computer, and all light vanishes. Through my cotton
                  blanket and the curtains, the darkness illuminates the last light, the moon, with
                  greater
                  luster. Surprised, I hadn’t even recognized the moon was alive. They call my name again,
                  this time with a more distinct feminine tone, this time quickly and more loudly. Who is
                  this
                  voice so quiet and violent in her ear? Who could it be?</p>

                <p>Look at Thomas–he’s dancing with the wind!</p>

                <p>Still no vodka. 15% off only today. Face roller for your feet.</p>

                <p>More laughter. His face slumps from its peak.</p>

                <p>Middle school boys care more about their sneakers soles than their souls. Clank.
                  Highschool
                  boys care about trucks. Clunka. The time between each stride takes away sound and
                  creates
                  space for thought. Clunkaclack. The jingle between the sound and the absence of it
                  blends
                  into a melodic drum that feeds into her head. A tune to forget. Clunkaclack tap.
                  Everything
                  separates together and the absent melody stops. Then she starts dancing.</p>

                <p>Take it easy, Hannah, it's okay.</p>

                <p>The crows won’t come to get you, it's okay, Maria won’t hurt you.</p>

                <p>Trevor on T.V. laughs. David on T.V. laughs even though he just did a minute ago. I don’t
                  need goldfish anymore.</p>

                <p>No one person can walk the same line at the same place. Matt likes walking in puddles
                  because it shows his physical line where only he walks at that specific moment. Other
                  people
                  could trace his footsteps in exactly the same way, but not at the same time, or they
                  would
                  be the same person. Could they be? Inked footsteps have vigor and life, where the motion
                  meets the shadow.</p>

                <p>Why do we look up when there’s so much on the ground? You can spread your perception of
                  the
                  world outside your own comfort zone, and open your eyes to the incredible world that
                  surrounds the bubble that you’ve grown to be content in. But time continues. Quickly
                  shuffling through the barrier, bumping into others, time continues. It pulls you in,
                  until
                  you can’t come out. It huddles you to its peak, and then it suddenly dies. Crowning
                  disaster
                  in a pair with shoes.</p>


                <p>Among the voices on the other side of the door, he detailed–then strayed–between the
                  whimpers of sound his great-aunts make when they cry of sadness. And the silence of the
                  recalcitrant men holding up their emotions. His father came back, then his grandmother.
                  He
                  felt the urge to reassure them that he was like everybody else, feeling grief like
                  everybody
                  else, but he felt nothing, there was no emotion. He shrugs it off. The atmosphere in the
                  room grasped him so much, it almost felt like a form of pity. Isolation in emotion,
                  isolation in the atmosphere. Still, tomorrow is Sunday, meaning there is school, he
                  thought.
                  He gently released himself from these differences and turned on the light. The darkness
                  in
                  the room merged with the sharp iPad light and I gently relieved the differences of the
                  outside world. Time advances and the voices fade. There’s no way to reject it, no way to
                  ever deny them.</p>

  The ghosts have come out, the ghosts have come out! 
  
  Hark! they are handing out
  
  lush candy
  
  To the young ones. 
  
  But nobody shouts. 
  
  
  The ghosts have come out, the ghosts have come out! 
  
  Hark! When the haunting nectar hangs up its drapery,
  
  the hollow shell falls 
  
  and claps the floor. Twisting and swirling, 
  
  Bitter shrapnel lines
  
  the frozen door–staining the bland sweetness
  
   that ran its rotting halls. 
  
  
  The ghosts have come out, the ghosts have come out!
  
  Hark! The ragged edges of their cement teeth
  
  crackle louder than the children’s shrieks
  
  Lots of hands are stirring
  
  But no feet skittle. 
  
  
  The ghosts have come out! The ghosts have–When we get stuck in your 
  
  silky, dingy nets, when you tangle 
  
  my sought retreat, remember! My eternal hum–
  A minute of sweet buzzing.

  Most people don’t 
  
  See  				  the stork in the redcap
  
  
  Who writes 			
        pithy poems				 on postcards. 
  
  a bleeding blanket 
  
  in the wavering		 wind, 
  
  he slices 
  
  the envelope 
  
  with his inked bayonet
  
  and all the words 
  
  come prancing				 out.
  
  Then he snatches 
  the swinging words		 with his claws
  
  Which he hides elegantly beneath his black-tipped wings
  
  keeping them to himself for an instant
  
  Then Unrolls 
  
  his wimpled wings
  
  leaving them
  in the layers of the mailbox
  Making sure the whirling words 
  Just slightly 		    evade his hand. 
  
  The man’s wife 
  
  Wanders to the mailbox 	scratching his head
  
  Who wrote this poem? He ponders
  
  The stork in the red cap
  
  keeps the dancing words to himself 
  
  Awkwardly drifting
  
            –feathering–		into the sky.

  What should I call a day as preposterous as night?
  
  The eye of sky dews dear in divine dark,
  
  its bloating snow sucks sight from tree’s blight,
  
  And her woods brim with sound of shading bark.
  
  Still time’s lease loosens in winter's sixteenth–
  
  Light’s embers kindle when wanton bequeaths!
  
  
  Nobody knew of the sky’s double tongue;
  
  More memories numb after frost forgets.
  
  Dreams asphyxiate in chambers of lung,
  
  And fairy’s finger’s wrap into time’s nets.
  
  Life’s limbs illusion more than night’s liars
  
  As stories of boundless sea drown desire.
  
  
  But some stories dance more temperate than eyes,
  
  For that my mouth translates no world but thanks,
  
  Since divine dreams chink before life’s grand prize.
  
  For the short winter is endless with pranks,
  
  The mind conjures more till death dies in dusk
  
  Oh! My tempest will gust to thou under the dust.

  One crook’d cross pleated in parted prayer:
  
  “Freedom beyond control!” moans dirty dirge from vain spire.
  
  Swooning seas of stars shaft their laden share,
  
  Though stained glass and taller choir chairs call “another!”
  
  Now stars descend on the hooves of east earth,
  
  Conflagrating ego and echo of deafening bells
  
  Salve the dying heirloom of waning worth. 
  
  From remnants of their twinkling coffin births the sky’s grain,
  
  Blustering winds ordain clouds to deplume
  
  Pied flower’s sun-stolen glory and bleeding bright reign.
  
  Enthroned golden at noon, now pecked to prune,
  
  Again hunts man’s pure ecstasy with the Great Gawain!
  
  Convulsing with all their pomp and power, 
  
  All wan and wry, their corpse deserts a dry wrinkled dour.

  He had no friends willing to tell his tale,
  
  The plight of justice which led the assail.
